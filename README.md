- **Admin Dashboard**: A secure management system to add food items, manage orders, and view analytics.  
- **Backend API**: A Node.js + Express server with MongoDB integration for handling authentication, orders, and data persistence.  

This application is designed to mimic a **real-world food delivery service** with smooth user experience and robust admin tools.
